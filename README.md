# Exploratory Data Analysis Report on Palmer Penguins

This exploratory data analysis report is part of a statistics assignment for a Master's degree at Newcastle University. The data used in this analysis is from the Palmer Station in Antarctica, focusing on the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) study area and specifically examining a sample of 200 penguins.

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to perform exploratory data analysis on the penguin data, including graphical and numerical summaries. Additionally, I aim to estimate probabilities/proportions for the penguin population by fitting a probability distribution to the data. I will also explore the variables that best distinguish between male and female penguins and investigate if the island of origin has a significant impact on physical characteristics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis includes the following components:

1. Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics for key variables (bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass).
2. Data Visualizations: Plots to visualize the distribution and relationships among variables.
3. Probability Distribution Fitting: Fitting a probability distribution to one of the measurement variables and estimating distribution parameters.
4. Sex Estimation: Identifying variables that best distinguish between male and female penguins.
5. Island Impact: Assessing the impact of the island of origin on physical characteristics.

## Getting Started

The analysis is presented in an R Markdown document. To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R Markdown document (`Project_Report_Dimitrios_Poulimenos_200291237.Rmd`) in an RStudio.
3. Knit the document to generate the final report.
